# Reinforcement Learning Mini-Project 2: Control in a Continuous Action Space with DDPG
This repository contains the implementation of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve a classical control problem: the stabilization of an inverted pendulum. The implementation is done from scratch in Python and uses the OpenAI Gym environment Pendulum-v1.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed, as well as the following libraries:

NumPy
PyTorch
OpenAI Gym
You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install numpy
pip install torch
pip install gym

## Usage
To run the code, simply open the DDPG_pendulum.ipynb notebook and run the cells. The notebook contains the implementation of the DDPG algorithm, as well as the training and testing loops.

You can modify the hyperparameters and other settings to experiment with different configurations. The results are displayed in the notebook, and you can also save the trained models and plots for later analysis.
